# Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview

The objective of this test plan is to outline the testing strategies and quality assurance processes for the crypto trading simulation application. The focus will be on ensuring the application functions correctly, meets user expectations, and performs optimally under various conditions.

## Goals

1. Validate the functionality of the application through unit testing.
2. Ensure that different modules work together seamlessly with integration testing.
3. Confirm that the application meets user requirements through user acceptance testing (UAT).
4. Optimize the application for performance and accuracy.

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Verify the individual components of the application to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
  
- **Approach**:
  - Write unit tests for each function and method within the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React.js) codebases.
  - Use frameworks such as `pytest` for Python and `Jest` for JavaScript to automate unit testing.

- **Key Areas to Test**:
  - API endpoints: Verify responses, error handling, and data validation.
  - Business logic: Validate algorithms used for trading simulations and calculations.
  - Component rendering: Ensure that React components display correctly based on different props and state.

### Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: Ensure that the various components of the application work together as expected.

- **Approach**:
  - Test the interactions between backend services, database operations, and frontend components.
  - Verify that data flows correctly through the application, from API requests to database storage and back to the user interface.

- **Key Areas to Test**:
  - Integration between FastAPI and MongoDB.
  - Interaction between React components and API endpoints.
  - Workflow scenarios, such as user registration, trade execution, and portfolio updates.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- **Purpose**: Validate the application against user requirements and expectations.

- **Approach**:
  - Conduct UAT sessions with actual users or stakeholders to gather feedback on the application's functionality and usability.
  - Create test cases that reflect real-world scenarios that users might encounter while using the application.

- **Key Areas to Test**:
  - User registration and login processes.
  - Trade execution and portfolio management features.
  - Analytics dashboards and reporting functionality.

## Performance Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the application performs well under various load conditions.

- **Approach**:
  - Use performance testing tools such as Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate concurrent users and measure application responsiveness.
  - Identify bottlenecks in the application and optimize performance, particularly in the backend API and database queries.

- **Key Metrics to Measure**:
  - Response times for API endpoints.
  - Load times for the frontend application.
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory) under heavy loads.

## Accuracy Testing

- **Objective**: Verify that calculations and data presented in the application are accurate.

- **Approach**:
  - Create test cases that compare the output of trading calculations (e.g., returns, fees) against expected results.
  - Validate the accuracy of market data retrieved from APIs and ensure it reflects true market conditions.

## Reporting and Documentation

- Document all testing results, including successes and failures, in a centralized report.
- Maintain a record of all test cases, testing scripts, and methodologies used throughout the testing phase.
