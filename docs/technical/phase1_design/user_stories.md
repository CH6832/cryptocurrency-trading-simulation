# User Stories

## Define User Stories

User stories are essential for understanding user needs and guiding the design process. Each user story includes a brief description of who the user is, what they want, and why. Here are some sample user stories for the crypto trading simulation:

### User Story 1

- **I want to** create an account,  
- **So that** I can access the trading simulation and track my performance.

### User Story 2
- **As an** experienced trader,  
- **I want to** view real-time market data,  
- **So that** I can make informed trading decisions.

### User Story 3
- **As a** user,  
- **I want to** execute trades (buy/sell),  
- **So that** I can manage my virtual portfolio effectively.

### User Story 4
- **As a** user,  
- **I want to** view my portfolio performance,  
- **So that** I can analyze my trading strategy.
