### User Interface (React.js)

Description: This is the frontend of the application where users interact with the platform.
Functionality:
Provides a visually appealing interface for users to perform actions like viewing market data, executing trades, and analyzing their portfolios.
Utilizes WebSocket for real-time updates, enabling instant feedback on trades and market changes.

### Application Layer (FastAPI)

Description: The backend service that handles API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
Functionality:
Receives requests from the User Interface, processes the data, and responds with the appropriate information.
Implements user authentication, trade execution logic, and interacts with the database and external APIs.

### Database (MongoDB)

Description: A NoSQL database that stores application data.
Functionality:
Holds collections for users, transactions, and portfolios.
Supports flexible data structures, allowing the application to evolve and scale easily.
Optimized for performance with indexing and potential sharding for handling high volumes of transactions.

### Crypto Data API

Description: An external service providing real-time cryptocurrency market data.
Functionality:
Supplies price feeds, market trends, and order book data.
This data is critical for executing trades accurately and updating the User Interface in real-time.

### Pub/Sub Messaging (Notification Service)

Description: A messaging system that handles real-time notifications and updates.
Functionality:
Manages communication between the application and connected clients via pub/sub messaging (like Redis Pub/Sub).
Facilitates instant notifications about trade executions, market alerts, and other events to users.

### Load Balancer

Description: A tool that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers.
Functionality:
Ensures that no single server is overwhelmed by requests, improving responsiveness and reliability.
Enables the application to scale horizontally by adding more instances as user demand increases.

### WebSocket Server

Description: A dedicated server handling real-time WebSocket connections from clients.
Functionality:
Listens for incoming connections and maintains persistent connections with clients for live data updates.
Pushes real-time market data and notifications to users, enhancing the user experience.

### Additional Considerations

Security: Implement robust security measures at each layer, including HTTPS for secure data transmission, JWT for user authentication, and proper validation/sanitization of input to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

Error Handling: Establish clear error handling and logging mechanisms to track issues and ensure smooth user experience.

Scalability: Design the application architecture with scalability in minThis includes not just horizontal scaling with load balancers but also considering auto-scaling features in cloud environments.

Monitoring: Implement application performance monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to keep track of system health and performance metrics.
