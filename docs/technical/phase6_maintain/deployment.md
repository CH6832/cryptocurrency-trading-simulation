# Deployment Plan for Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance

## Overview

The deployment plan outlines the strategies and processes for deploying the crypto trading simulation application to a cloud infrastructure. A successful deployment ensures that the application is accessible, scalable, and robust.

## Objectives

1. Deploy the application on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
2. Configure the infrastructure to ensure high availability and performance.
3. Set up necessary monitoring and error logging for the deployed application.

## Deployment Strategies

### Cloud Infrastructure Selection

- **Options**:
  - **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Offers a wide range of services, including EC2 for hosting, RDS for databases, and S3 for storage.
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Provides Compute Engine for virtual machines, Cloud SQL for managed databases, and Cloud Storage for object storage.
  - **Microsoft Azure**: Features Azure App Services for web hosting, Azure SQL Database for relational data, and Blob Storage for unstructured data.

- **Recommendation**: Choose a platform based on team expertise, project requirements, and cost considerations.

### Environment Setup

- **Production Environment**:
  - Create a production environment that mimics the local development setup.
  - Provision necessary resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, and databases.

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Utilize tools like Terraform or Ansible for infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage deployments and configurations.

### Deployment Pipeline

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI to automate testing and deployment.
  - Ensure that each code change goes through testing before being deployed to production.

- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. Build the application artifacts.
  2. Run automated tests to verify the integrity of the application.
  3. Deploy the application to the cloud environment.
  4. Monitor the deployment process and resolve any issues that arise.

### Post-Deployment

- **Monitoring Setup**:
  - Implement monitoring solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Stackdriver) to track application performance, resource usage, and user activity.

- **Error Logging**:
  - Configure error logging systems (e.g., Sentry, ELK Stack) to capture application errors and provide insights into potential issues.

### 5. Documentation

- **Deployment Documentation**:
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation of the deployment process, including environment configurations, CI/CD setups, and troubleshooting steps.
  - Ensure that documentation is updated with any changes made during the deployment or maintenance phases.
