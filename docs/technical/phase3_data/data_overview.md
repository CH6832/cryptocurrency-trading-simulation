# Market Data Integration & Order Simulation

1. Integrate real-time market data via Yahoo Finance.
2. Implement order execution logic that simulates buy and sell orders, considering fees, slippage, and bid/ask spreads.
3. Update the user's portfolio based on executed trades.
4. Conduct testing and validation to ensure the reliability of the implementation.

## Available API for Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data

### Yahoo Finance API

- **Description**: Yahoo Finance provides a comprehensive API that allows access to real-time market data, including prices, market capitalization, and trading volume for various cryptocurrencies.

- **Usage**: The Yahoo Finance API can be accessed through various methods, including direct HTTP requests or third-party libraries that facilitate data retrieval.

- **Features**:
  - Access to current prices for numerous cryptocurrencies.
  - Historical market data for trend analysis.
  - Integration with stock data, providing a holistic view of market performance.

- **Documentation**: While Yahoo Finance does not have an official API documentation page, there are various libraries and tools available that can be used to interact with Yahoo Finance data, such as `yfinance` in Python.

## Implementation Steps

### Integrate Market Data API

- **API Selection**: Choose Yahoo Finance as the primary source for real-time cryptocurrency data. Evaluate the API capabilities to ensure it meets the application's needs for accuracy and update frequency.

- **API Integration**: Set up the backend to handle requests for market data from Yahoo Finance. Consider using a reliable third-party library or service that facilitates communication with the Yahoo Finance API.

### Order Execution Logic

- **Define Order Types**: Specify the types of orders that will be supported in the trading simulation, such as:
  - **Market Orders**: Executed immediately at the current market price.
  - **Limit Orders**: Executed at a specified price or better.

- **Simulate Order Execution**:
  - Implement the logic for executing trades based on user input.
  - Include considerations for transaction fees, slippage, and bid/ask spreads, which will impact the final executed price of trades.

### Portfolio Update Logic

- **Adjust User Portfolio**: After each trade execution, update the user's virtual portfolio to reflect the new balances and performance metrics.
  - Ensure that the portfolio updates are accurate, reflecting both the currency amounts and the value of the portfolio based on real-time market data.

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the market data integration and order execution logic to ensure accuracy and reliability.
  - Develop test cases that simulate various trading scenarios, including the execution of both market and limit orders under different market conditions.
