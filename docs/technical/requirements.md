### Technology Stack

#### Backend
   - **Language**: Python
   - **Framework**: FastAPI or Flask for serving RESTful API
   - **Libraries**: 
     - **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy for calculations and data manipulation
     - **API Requests**: `requests` for external API calls
     - **Real-Time**: WebSocket support with FastAPI (for real-time updates)

#### Frontend
   - **Language**: JavaScript
   - **Framework**: React.js for a responsive, component-based UI
   - **State Management**: Redux or React Context for handling complex state
   - **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for real-time charts and analytics

#### Database
   - **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data storage, ideal for evolving structures such as:
     - User profiles
     - Portfolio data and trade history
     - Real-time price data and performance metrics
   - **Data Storage Structure**: Collections will be organized by user accounts, portfolios, trade logs, and historical market data snapshots.

### Additional Tools
   - **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session handling
   - **API Integration**: External crypto data API (e.g., Binance, CoinGecko) for real-time and historical prices
   - **Caching**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as price updates, to optimize data retrieval speed and reduce load on the database
   - **Version Control**: Git for code management and collaboration

### Concurrency and Multi-User Access

#### Goal

Enable concurrent access, allowing multiple users to access, trade, and analyze portfolios simultaneously, with minimal latency and no data conflicts. Each user should experience real-time updates, accurate data isolation, and smooth performance.

#### Concurrency Management

1. **Backend Concurrency Management**
   - **Asynchronous Processing**: Use **FastAPI** with asynchronous endpoints to handle multiple requests concurrently, minimizing latency.
   - **Task Queues**: Offload resource-intensive tasks (e.g., backtesting) to background workers using task queues like **Celery** or **Redis Queue**. This ensures the main server is available for real-time interactions.
   - **WebSocket for Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSocket connections in FastAPI to push live updates to users without polling, reducing network load and improving the user experience.

2. **Database Transactions and Isolation**
   - **Atomic Transactions**: Ensure each trade and portfolio update is an atomic operation to prevent data conflicts. MongoDB's **ACID compliance for single-document transactions** helps maintain data integrity for trades and balance updates.
   - **Optimistic Locking**: Implement optimistic locking for critical operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent updates.

3. **Session and State Management**
   - **Session Isolation**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication, ensuring each user's session is securely isolated.
   - **Caching**: Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., live prices and recent trade data) to serve data faster to multiple users.

4. **Frontend State Synchronization**
   - **State Management with Redux**: Use Redux to manage global state for each user session in React, ensuring smooth handling of concurrent UI updates.
   - **Optimistic UI Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates on the frontend to reflect user actions instantly, enhancing responsiveness.

5. **Load Balancing and Scalability**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple instances of the backend service.
   - **Database Sharding**: As user volume grows, consider sharding MongoDB collections for performance under high concurrency.
